This app integrates Flexit Nordic ventilation units with Homey Pro. It supports two connection methods:

Local (BACnet): Discovers units on the local network via BACnet/IP. Homey Pro and the Flexit unit must be on the same network. No cloud account required.

Cloud: Connects via the Flexit cloud using your Flexit GO account credentials. Works from any network — no local network access needed.

Both drivers provide the same capabilities: set supply air target temperature, change ventilation mode (Away, Home, High, Fireplace, Cooker Hood), toggle electric heater, and view temperatures, humidity, fan data, heater power, and filter status.

Flows can also stop the unit entirely with the "Stop ventilation" action, and react to the unit being stopped. Stopping is not a fire safety function: to shut ventilation down on a smoke alarm, connect the alarm to the unit's own smoke detector input instead.

Free cooling can be turned on or off from flows with the "Turn free cooling on" and "Turn free cooling off" actions, for example to allow it in summer only. The unit still decides when free cooling actually runs, based on its extract temperature setpoint and outdoor temperature limit in the device settings.
